# VENICE-TIDES-DATA
Venice Tides and the impact climate change had on them.

Abstract:
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of tide data for the city of Venice, Italy, spanning the years 1960 to 2023. The dataset, compiled from current tide measurements obtained from the Centro Maree API and historical data from the ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale) archives, provides valuable insights into the long-term trends and impacts of climate change on the city's tidal conditions.
The analysis reveals a clear seasonal pattern in average monthly water levels, with higher levels typically observed during the winter months. Additionally, the data shows a steady increase in annual maximum water levels over the past decades, indicating a growing frequency and severity of high tide events. Notably, the strong correlation (r = 0.85) between water levels and sea level rise highlights the significant role that rising sea levels play as a driver of these changes.
These findings demonstrate the substantial impact of climate change, particularly sea level rise, on the vulnerability of Venice to flooding and coastal hazards. The dataset and research presented here can inform local adaptation strategies, support decision-making processes, and contribute to the broader understanding of the challenges faced by coastal cities in the face of a changing climate.

Dataset and Research Description:
"This dataset and accompanying research provide a comprehensive analysis of tide data for the city of Venice, Italy, covering the period from 1960 to 2023. The dataset includes water level measurements from multiple tide stations across the city, as well as relevant metadata such as station locations, water level thresholds, and quality control information.
The research utilizes this dataset to investigate the long-term trends and patterns in Venice's tidal conditions, with a particular focus on the impacts of climate change. Key findings include the identification of seasonal variations in water levels, the detection of a steady increase in annual maximum water levels, and the quantification of the strong correlation between water levels and sea level rise.
These insights contribute to a better understanding of the challenges facing Venice and other coastal cities in adapting to the effects of climate change. The dataset and research findings can be used by local authorities, policymakers, urban planners, and the broader scientific community to inform decision-making, develop adaptation strategies, and support further research on the topic.
